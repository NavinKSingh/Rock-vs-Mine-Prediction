Rock vs Mine Prediction README
Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to classify sonar signals as either "Rock" or "Mine". The model utilizes the Logistic Regression algorithm from the scikit-learn library to predict the type of object based on sonar data.

Dependencies
To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:

numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
You can install these libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a CSV file named sonar data.csv, which contains sonar readings from various objects. Each row represents a sonar signal, and the last column (indexed at 60) indicates whether the signal corresponds to a "Rock" or a "Mine".

Code Walkthrough
Importing Libraries: Necessary libraries such as numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn are imported.

Loading the Dataset:

python
Copy code
sonar_data = pd.read_csv('D:\Rock vs Mine Predction\Copy of sonar data.csv', header=None)
Data Exploration: The dataset is explored using methods like head(), shape, size, describe(), and value_counts() to understand its structure and contents.

Preparing the Data:

Features (x) are separated from the target variable (y).
The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
Model Training:

python
Copy code
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(x_train, y_train)
Model Evaluation:

The model's accuracy is evaluated on both training and testing datasets using accuracy_score.
Making Predictions:

The user is prompted to enter comma-separated sonar data, which is then reshaped and used for prediction.
Output: The model predicts whether the input data corresponds to a "Rock" or a "Mine".

How to Run the Code
Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries.
Place the sonar data.csv file in the specified directory (D:\Rock vs Mine Predction\).
Run the script in your preferred Python environment.
Input sonar data when prompted, in the format of comma-separated values.
Example Input
To predict an object, you might enter data like this:

Copy code
0.02,0.03,0.12,0.15,0.05,0.07,0.10,0.02,0.03,0.12,0.15,0.05,0.07,0.10,0.02,0.03,0.12,0.15,0.05,0.07,0.10,0.02,0.03,0.12,0.15,0.05,0.07,0.10,0.02,0.03,0.12,0.15,0.05,0.07,0.10,0.02,0.03,0.12,0.15,0.05,0.07,0.10
Conclusion
This project serves as an introduction to using machine learning for classification tasks with sonar data. The Logistic Regression model effectively distinguishes between different types of objects based on sonar signals, demonstrating the potential of machine learning in real-world applications.
